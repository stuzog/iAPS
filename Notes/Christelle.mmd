this is what I did in less tech terms on my Mac laptop:
Email log to self
Open log_prev.txt
Command F will open up “find” aka like a search
Enter what u are looking for, for example “SMB is limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes” and see what comes up. Then scroll through them and see how much the algorithm is limiting your insulin delivery.
Do the math like you did when u found them using the “hints” and up your UAMSMB basal minutes by that amount.
Math example: algorithm gave u 1 unit when it says it really wanted to give you 3. 3/1=3 which means u needed 3x the dose. So up you UAM basal minutes by 3x

I'm hoping this helps. I was in the same boat for awhile but finally think I figured it out. If this doesn't seem right someone else can pipe in

the problem with this is that the overall idea is to "ignore" the extreme SMBs ... so for instance, you want to count how many lines match:
grep SMBBasal <logfile> | grep limited
and then look for how many lines match:
grep SMBBasal <logfile> | grep "is limited"
is the latter accounts for <5% of all lines, then don't change your settings

Agreed. That makes sense to me. I finally had figured out what you meant by the 5% “rule”. I just typed in either limited or is not limited to get the numbers for both. If the “is limited” #/“is not limited” #, multiplied by 100 was less than 5 then I didn't change anything.
